#Advent of Code 2025
My solutions to the Advent of Code 2025 programming challenges.
About This Repository
Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming puzzles that run from December 1st through 25th. Each day presents a two-part problem that tests algorithmic thinking, data structures, and problem-solving skills.
I'm using this year's challenge to sharpen my skills in areas directly relevant to data science and ML engineering work:

Algorithmic problem-solving — writing efficient solutions under constraints, a skill that translates directly to optimizing data pipelines and ML workflows
Python fluency — strengthening my command of the language I use daily for data analysis and modeling
Clean, readable code — practicing writing solutions that are not just correct but easy to understand and maintain
Edge case handling — building the habit of thinking through corner cases, which is critical when working with messy real-world data
